# React Challenge

Test your React and web development skills with this challenge.

Install application dependencies with:

    $ npm install

Start the application with:

    $ npm start

## The challenge

Start by reading through the application and trying to understand it.

### Basic tasks:

- [ ] Add two additional fields: username and location
- [ ] Require all fields to be non-blank when submitting
- [ ] Show an error message if not all fields have been filled
- [ ] Add an "Edit" button to go back to the Form from the Profile component

### Bonus tasks:

- [ ] Improve the application styles
- [ ] Extract the form label and text inputs into a reusable `FormInput`
  component to avoid repetition
- [ ] Add a transition between the Form and Profile components using
  [ReactCSSTransitionGroup](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html)

Take your time with the challenge, and focus on solving each problem in an
elegant manner.
